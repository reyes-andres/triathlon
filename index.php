    <p class="subti">What is triathlon?</p>
    <p class="columna1">A triathlon is a multiple-stage competition involving the completion of three 
continuous and sequential endurance disciplines. While many variations of the 
sport exist, triathlon, in its most popular form, involves swimming, cycling, 
and running in immediate succession over various distances. Triathletes compete 
for fastest overall course completion time, including timed "transitions" between 
the individual swim, cycle, and run components. The word "triathlon" is of Greek 
origin from τρεις or treis (three) and αθλος or athlos (contest).</p>

    <p class="subti">Paratriathlon</p>
<p class="columna3">Paratriathlon is a variant of the triathlon for athletes with a physical disability. 
 The sport is governed by the International Triathlon Union (ITU), and will first be held as a Paralympic
 event at the 2016 Summer Paralympics to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The annual ITU Triathlon World Championships includes a paratriathlon sprint distance event with a 750m swim, 20 km cycling using handcycles, bicycles or tandem bicycles with a guide and a 5 km wheelchair or running race. Athletes compete in six categories according to the nature of their physical impairments.</p>
